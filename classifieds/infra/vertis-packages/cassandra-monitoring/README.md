cassandra-monitoring
====================

Here you can find ```mon-nodetool``` and monrun configs.   

```mon-nodetool``` is monitoring tool that is based on ```nodetool``` and looks like ```nodetool```.  
The main point is having the same options as ```nodetool``` but get a monitoring status instead of a human friendly output.
