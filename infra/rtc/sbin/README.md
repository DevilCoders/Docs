# Canonical place for modern sysadmin binaries used by RTC SRE on hosts.

## Conventions

- Respect arcadia build rules (files layout, depends and so on).
- This place designated to contain general-purpose sysadmin related tools (what
  usually expected in `/sbin/` dir). Please do not put here anything else.

## Questions

- Should we build them in deb and deploy to hosts?
