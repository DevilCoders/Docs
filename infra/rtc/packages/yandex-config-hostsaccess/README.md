## What??
This package provides `/etc/hosts.allow` file which with libwrap (linked with sshd) works 
as whitelist for IP connections.

## Why??
Seems like an obscure but pretty static mechanism to restrict SSH access to HOSTS.

## Whom?
... should one ask if you have questions? Someone from CSO office, namely, ezaitov@.
