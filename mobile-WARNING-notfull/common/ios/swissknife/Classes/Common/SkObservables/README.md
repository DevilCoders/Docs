#  About SkObservables

mostly, this is a borrowed thing from respectful developers at Bro&PP
this code is mostly some kind of weirdful rewrite of code, located here https://bitbucket.browser.yandex-team.ru/projects/STARDUST/repos/browser/browse/src/base/ios/yandex/reactive

why? because we can, joke!
mostly to lay the way no to git clone full (or partially) stardust repository and make
components that can be also distributed as CocoaPods even to BroPP and not making conflicts
with original classes (to avoid situation when we link to CommonCore in our pod and link back
to BroPP)

all tomatoes should go to mrdekk@
