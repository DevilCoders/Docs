# Integration with iiko

The Yandex Delivery integration with iiko enables you to send orders received from any platform out for delivery. You don't even need your own couriers.

## Module benefits

* You can send any order from iiko for delivery if payment is accepted for it.
* In iikoWeb, you can set up the integration or change the settings.
* You can specify special requirements (thermal bag, car courier) and additional options (SMS confirmation).
* If you enter a courier call interval in the settings, the courier will arrive as soon as the meal is ready.
* After sending the claim, you can track its execution and contact the performer.
* Integration developed by iiko. You can send questions about the module to your iiko dealer.

## System requirements:

* Integration is available for iiko version 7.5.6 and higher.
* Integration is available for iikoCloud and Life-time plans if you have the iikoDelivery module. The Life-time plan requires an iikoAPI Cloud license.
* Both individual restaurants and chains are supported. An exception is the "mini chain" configuration where several trading enterprises are combined into one RMS. Follow the rule: 1 RMS server = 1 restaurant address.
* The iikoTransport service must be installed on the terminal where Yandex Delivery couriers will be assigned to deliver orders.
* The Plugin.Front.DeliveryExternalCourierService integration plugin must be installed on the terminal where couriers will be assigned to deliver orders.
