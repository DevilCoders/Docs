# Integration with Smartomato

Smartomato is an online platform for organizing restaurant delivery. The Yandex Delivery integration with Smartomato gives you a robust solution. Integration is performed wherever orders are accepted: websites, widgets, client mobile apps, and delivery management mobile apps. Current prices from Yandex Delivery (even before sending a claim), active delivery statuses, and full outsourcing management are available everywhere.

## Integration benefits

* Select the most relevant plan and set special delivery requirements.
* Assign delivery zones created in Smartomato to Yandex Delivery.
* The Yandex Delivery cost for the restaurant customer is calculated automatically, and it starts during the order process. The customer can view the current price, adjusted for Smartomato's subsidy policy, on the restaurant's website or app at all stages of the order process.
* Smartomato independently generates a delivery claim: the restaurant and client's addresses, contact information, and other order information are pulled up automatically.
* The claim can be sent to Yandex Delivery:
  * Automatically after creating an order.
  * Automatically after order confirmation.
  * Manually via the order card in Smartomato.
* When a Yandex Delivery courier is assigned, their name, phone number, and car information are displayed in the Smartomato interface.
* The Yandex Delivery courier arrives at the restaurant at the order pickup time, which is calculated by Smartomato based on the restaurant's settings.
* All stages of the Yandex Delivery process can be tracked in Smartomato.
* If you cancel an order in Smartomato, the order will be automatically canceled in Yandex Delivery.
* Information about the selected delivery method and cost is available in standard Smartomato reports.
