## 1C integration requirements

* To use the service, you need to register in the 1C:Business Network. This can be done for free from the 1C software.
* To work with Yandex Delivery, you must have a Corporate Client Account on the service portal. If you don't have one, you can fill out an application to connect directly from the integration module.
* You will also need a special API key (token). You can get it in the Corporate Client Account. You'll find detailed instructions on how to do this in the 1C application on the form for connecting carriers.
* To enable integration, follow these [instructions](https://its.1c.ru/video/1c_courier).
