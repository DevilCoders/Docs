# Introduction

The Yandex Delivery API provides corporate clients with an option to use HTTP requests for ordering cargo transportation.

You can make an order for Express Delivery in the nearest time, that is, start searching for the performer immediately after confirming the claim, or make a deferred order â€” set the desired parameters for the driver arrival at point A.
You can also use Same Day Delivery, order will be delivered at selected hourly intervals.

Before getting started with the API, [get an OAuth token](access.md).

Create a claim and track the order status via the API under the [claim processing procedure](claim-process.md).

If you have any issues, contact your Yandex Delivery manager.
