# taxi-client
Repository for regular processes of the taxi Competitive Intelligence team

### Getting started
1. Create a folder at your virtual machine for the repository and move to it
```
mkdir git-dir
cd git-dir
```
2. Clone repository here
```
git clone https://github.yandex-team.ru/ikars/taxi-client
```
You will be asked for your domain login (e.g. ```ikars```) and password.
```
> Username for 'https://github.yandex-team.ru': ikars
> Password for 'https://ikars@github.yandex-team.ru':
```
Having successfully entered login and password you will be able to see a folder ```taxi-client```:
```
ls
> taxi-client
```
3. Now you can change to the directory and work with the repository locally:
```
cd taxi-client
```
### Committing changes
1. First, go to the repository folder:
```
cd git-dir/taxi-client
```
2. Do everything new you want. Create new folders, write new scripts etc.
3. Add your new folder to repository (e.g. ```cron```)
```
git add cron
```
4. Commit your changes
```
git commit -m 'adding cron folder for all regular processess'
```
5. Pull changes for respository consistence
```
git pull
```
6. Finally, push your changes

### Unfortunately, now you should do all of these steps using arc instead of git :(
