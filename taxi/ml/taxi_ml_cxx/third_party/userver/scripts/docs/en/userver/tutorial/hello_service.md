## Writing your first HTTP server

## Before you start

Make sure that you can compile and run core tests.

## Step by step guide

Typical HTTP server application in userver consists of the following parts:
* HTTP handler component - main logic of your application
* Static config - startup config that does not change for the whole lifetime of an application
* Dynamic config - config that could be changed at runtime
* int main() - startup code

Let's write a simple server that responds with "Hello world!\n" on every request to `/hello` URL.

### HTTP handler component

HTTP handlers must derive from `server::handlers::HttpHandlerBase` and have a name, that 
is obtainable at compile time via `kName` variable and is obtainable at runtime via `HandlerName()`.

The primary functionality of the handler should be located in `HandleRequestThrow` function.
Return value of this function is the HTTP response body. If an exception `exc` derived from
`server::handlers::CustomHandlerException` is thrown from the function then the
HTTP response code will be set to `exc.GetCode()` and `exc.GetExternalErrorBody()`
would be used for HTTP response body. Otherwise if the an exception `exc` derived from
`std::exception` is thrown from the function then the
HTTP response code will be set to `500`.

@warning `Handle*` functions are invoked concurrently on the same instance of the handler class. Use @ref md_en_userver_synchronization "synchronization primitives" or do not modify shared data in `Handle*`.


### Static config

Now we have to configure the service by providing `coro_pool`, `task_processors` and `default_task_processor` options for the components::ManagerControllerComponent and
configuring each component in `components` section:

@snippet samples/hello_service.cpp  Hello service sample - static config

Note that all the @ref userver_components "components" and @ref userver_http_handlers "handlers" have their static options additionally described in docs.

### Dynamic config

We are not planning to get new dynamic config values in this sample. Because of
that we just write the defaults to the fallback file of the `components::TaxiConfigFallbacksComponent` component.

All the values are described in a separate section @ref md_en_schemas_dynamic_configs .

@snippet samples/hello_service.cpp  Hello service sample - dynamic config

A production ready service would dynamically retrieve the above options at runtime from a configuration service. See
@ref md_en_userver_tutorial_config_service for insights on how to change the
above options on the fly, without restarting the service.


### int main()

Finally, after writing down the dynamic config values into file at `taxi-config-fallbacks.fallback-path`, we
add our component to the `components::MinimalServerComponentList()`,
and start the server with static config `kStaticConfig`.

### Build
To build the sample, execute the following build steps at the userver root directory:
```
mkdir build_release
cd build_release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make userver-samples-hello_service
```

Start the server by running `./samples/userver-samples-hello_service`.
Now you can send a request to your server from another terminal:
```
bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/hello
Hello world!
```
