# Select

Select component based on [react-select](https://react-select.com/home) library.

## TODO

- [ ] Use own props typing - core library typings are not full and sometimes errorneous. Put new typings in [ReactSelect.tsx](./ReactSelect.tsx)
- [ ] Use names for props that are correlated with other library components - e.g. `progress` instead of `isLoading`
- [ ] Divide into single and multi select
