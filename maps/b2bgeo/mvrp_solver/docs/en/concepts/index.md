# Introduction

Welcome to Yandex.Routing!

Here you'll find a description of the features of the Route Planning Service (hereinafter â€” the Router), learn how to create optimization tasks using Microsoft Excel or the API, and read about general and special cases of route planning.

The documentation is intended for both business users and software developers and provides information about how to upload routes through the web interface and API and get ready-made solutions.

## What do we optimize?

The route planning service of Yandex.Routing helps you optimize order distribution or courier delivery tasks.

If you have:

- Your own vehicles, couriers, or hired transport.
- Orders that need to be picked up or delivered by a specific time within a day.
- A depot to collect goods from.

The Router will set optimal routes for your couriers. All orders will be completed on time using the minimum number of couriers.

The service optimizes direct costs for transport logistics. This helps you handle the current volume of orders faster and using fewer vehicles.

Thanks to information about traffic conditions from Yandex.Maps, the service provides an accurate forecast for the time of arrival at order locations, reducing the number of late arrivals and vehicle downtime.

## How it works

To optimize routes, you need to configure and upload data about your vehicles, orders, and depot.

The service performs route optimization in a few minutes. The response contains the sequence of order deliveries at destinations for each vehicle, with a predicted time of arrival at each order location.
