# Working through the API and editing a solution through the interface

We recommend the following scenario:

1. The solution is sent via the API from the source system.
2. A business user logs in to the [Yandex.Routing](https://yandex.com.tr/courier) interface and then [views or edits the solution](interface-opportunities.md#redaktirovanie-resheniia).
3. If the solution was edited, the user [saves a link to the final version](interface-opportunities.md#sokhranenie-konechnogo-resheniia) and uses it on the source side. If the solution wasn't edited, the user confirms, on their side, that they're satisfied with the received solution.
4. The final solution is downloaded in the usual way via the API.

{% note %}

The final solution is re-optimized after manual adjustments. So you need to work with it the same way as with other tasks in the Route Optimization API, that is, wait for this task to be completed.
