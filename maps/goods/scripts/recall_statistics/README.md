# Recall Statistics

These scripts are used to calculate Funduk data recall, i.e. the part of shown cards containing goods. The field for grouping can be specified through the parameters, so recall can be calculated by different "slices". Nirvana + reactor are used to launch recall calculations and datalens is used to build charts and put them on the dashboard:
