[prepare_dataset_1](prepare_dataset_1) | 1st stage. Deals all the work with finding manoeuvres and counting user statistics on YT.
[prepare_dataset_2](prepare_dataset_2) | 2nd stage. Given a table from the 1st stage, appends corresponding images to each row and stores resulting dataset in a sandbox resource. Should be ran on SandboxÂ©. Also starts 3rd stage via Nirvana API.
[pytorch](pytorch) | 3rd stage. Trains a neural network to predict the annotation for the manoeuvre. Currently is running with Nirvana Python DL. Uploads estimates to YT.
[upload](upload) | 4th stage. Uploads hypotheses to nmaps.
