Description of test graph.
===

Graph is represented by 3 on 3 manhattan lattice with
x and y cells of size 1 and 9 in degrees. Also added one
edge from (10, 10) to (0, 0) by polyline crossing one point
(-1, 2). Categories are 1 to 7 cyclically: edge 0 has 1, edge 1 has 2,
etc, edge 6 has 7, edge 7 has 1.

Edges from 13 to 20 are 2-segments loops with both segments geolengths
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4.
So they start at a point, go 1 to 4 meters to another point and the go back
the same way. So edges lengths are twice those mentioned above.
Edges go from and to vertex number 9.
They have no categories or other properties set.
