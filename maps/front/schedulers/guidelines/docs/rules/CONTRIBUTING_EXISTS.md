# CONTRIBUTING_EXISTS

Requires `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Rationale
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project is used when trying to run the service for the first time.

## Solution
Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of your service and fill in the following details:
1. Dependencies needed for the project to be ran in dev mode and for running tests
1. How to start the service in dev mode
1. How to run service's tests
1. How release a new version of the service in testing/production
1. Everything else that can be helpful when getting to know the dev/release infrastructure of the service
