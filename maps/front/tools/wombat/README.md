# Wombat installer

This project stub is good for SPA projects which use [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [webpack](webpack.github.io) for assembling.

- Inspired by [baby-loris](https://github.yandex-team.ru/islets/baby-loris)
- `Nodemon` and `Webpack` watch file changes
- `Webpack-Hot-Module-Replacement`

### How to install

```
bash <arcadia-path>/maps/front/tools/wombat/install.sh
cd <your project name>
```

Then open `README.md` file for reading how to use created project.

Good luck!
