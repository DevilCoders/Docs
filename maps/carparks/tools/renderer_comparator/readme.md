# renderer\_comparator
Compares protobuf tiles generated by two carparks renderers and outputs result
to stdout in json format. This tool was originally intended for comparing
yet-to-be-released carparks datasets against released ones for automatic
validation and releasing.
## Comparison
Tile ranges to compare are derived from regions specified in regions
configuration file. For each range all tiles fetched from one renderer are
compared to corresponding tiles fetched from second renderer.
Tiles comparison is simplified to comparing features count of compared tiles
and whether attributes of compared tiles are permutation of each other. For
each region total statistics is displayed alongside with
tiles with most differencies.
To specify region you have to provide its name, geo rect and zoom. More than
1 region can be specified in configuration (separate report is generated for
each region). For configuration file example see
[maps/carparks/tools/renderer\_comparator/regions.json.example](https://a.yandex-team.ru/arc/trunk/arcadia/maps/carparks/tools/renderer_comparator/config/regions.json.example).<br>
## CLI
To list command line options use `./renderer_comparator --help`.
### Usage example
`./renderer_comparator -f http://core-carparks-renderer-lots.datatesting.maps.n.yandex.ru -s http://core-carparks-renderer-lots.testing.maps.n.yandex.ru  --regions ../config/regions.json.example -o output.json`
