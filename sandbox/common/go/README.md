Sandbox go autogenerated client
==

Development notes:

* Two generators are used:
  * `make/swag_gen` generates full source code and packs it to `make/lazy_gen`
  * `make/lazy_gen` extracts single package following `ya.make` structure

Regenerating ya.make.inc files:

```bash
ya m ./make/lazy_gen && ./make/lazy_gen/lazy-gen update-library .
```


User guide:

For IDE code navigation use:

```bash
ya make --add-result go clients models
```
