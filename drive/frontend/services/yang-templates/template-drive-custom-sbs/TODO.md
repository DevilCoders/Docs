* ~~Port from Typescript to JS before passing to other team~~ **DONE**
* ~~Remove Trendbox integration~~ **DONE**
* Get rid of antd, port to crowd-components
* Consider switching to watermark-proxy (react-wp-viewer already allows it)
* Add Thirium tests
* This project's functionality (presets etc) should probably be merged with the main documents template, since Drive wants to have editable single-documents forms in the future
