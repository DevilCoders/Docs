# Introduction

Developers of websites and web applications can use the Yandex ID API to uniquely identify Yandex users. This means the developer can personalize the content or application interface shown to a user.

The username and unique Yandex ID are available for any valid [Yandex OAuth token](oauth/concepts/about.md). Using the Yandex ID API to log in with Yandex is described in the form of a [typical authentication scenario](api-id/tasks/algorithm.md).

To request a user's personal information, you need to get an OAuth token with permissions to access the Yandex ID API. You can request the following data:

- First and last name
    
- Nickname
    
- Gender
    
- Date of birth
    
- Email address
    
- Phone number
    
- Profile picture
    

For more information, see [Requesting user information](api-id/reference/request.md) and [Response format and content](api-id/reference/response.md).
