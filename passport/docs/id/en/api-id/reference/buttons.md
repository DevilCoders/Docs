# Sample buttons

You can use the buttons provided below on your website to let users log in via Yandex.

## Main button version {#basic}

We recommend using the version with the large contrast button as it may improve your website's conversion rate for authorization.

## Additional version {#option}

If you don't want to use the main button version, you can use the additional one. For example, you can place the Yandex button next to the buttons for other services.

## Full and short formats {#full-and-short}

If you only have the Yandex button, use the full format “Log in with Yandex ID”.

If there are multiple buttons, add the heading “Log in with” followed by the short button format.
