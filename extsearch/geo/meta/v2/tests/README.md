# Tests

## pytests
A library contains test functions, but does not define how the metasearch is launched. The tests are suitable to check both lite and usual daemons.

## env/stable
Fixtures to start lite metasearch daemon (single process) pointing to external stable sources.

## bin_pytest_lite
`PY3TEST` that runs the tests over the lite metasearch.
